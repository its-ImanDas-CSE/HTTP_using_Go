# HTTP_using_Go
In Go, the `net/http` package simplifies creating HTTP servers and clients. Use `http.HandleFunc` to define routes and `http.ListenAndServe` to start servers. For clients, use `http.Get` or `http.Client` to send requests and handle responses. Its simplicity and efficiency make Go ideal for building web applications and APIs.
